# Face-Recognition-web-app-in-Flask-and-Deployment


In this project we have our image dataset which consists of human faces , we will do
some processes :

1)Detecting the faces

  1-Detecting Faces using harcascaded classifier

  2-crop the faces

  3-label each image

2)structure images and labelling :

  1-unstructured dimensions of cropped images to structured data dimensions

  2-resizing

3)extract features:

  1-eigen faces

  2-using PCA to extract features from faces and get the numerical python array

4) Machine Learning Model and Deployment :
  using svc
